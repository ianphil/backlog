# Backlog - Product Requirements Document

# Backlog Concept
## Introducing TaskOps!
**Backlog** is a hyper-advanced task management system designed to function as a dynamic backlog for an AI, enabling it to prioritize, direct, and execute tasks with operational precision. It serves as an organized repository of work—bridging human-defined goals with AI-driven execution—by breaking down objectives into structured, actionable tasks that an AI can process, manage, and complete. Integrated with a command-line interface (CLI) and AI capabilities, Backlog empowers an AI to maintain and refine its own task queue—creating, updating, and removing tasks—while offering human oversight through a transparent, file-based system. This concept positions Backlog as a strategic tool for AI agents, optimizing their workflow in a fluid, iterative environment.

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

### API Reliability
**Risk**: OpenAI API could have downtime, rate limiting, or breaking changes.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust error handling with exponential backoff using Python libraries.
- Cache important or expensive responses where appropriate.
- Potentially support alternative compatible APIs or local models in the future.
- Clearly document API key requirements and potential costs.

### Model Output Variability
**Risk**: AI models may produce inconsistent or unexpected outputs.
**Mitigation**:
- Design robust prompt templates with clear instructions and desired output formatting.
- Implement response validation and error detection in Python.
- Add self-correction mechanisms (e.g., re-prompting on invalid format).
- Allow easy manual editing/override of generated content via CLI or files.

### Python Version/Dependency Compatibility
**Risk**: Differences in Python versions or dependencies could cause issues.
**Mitigation**:
- Clearly document minimum Python version requirements.
- Use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for explicit dependency pinning.
- Leverage virtual environments (`venv`).
- Test across target Python versions.

## MVP Definition

### Feature Prioritization
**Risk**: Including too many features in the MVP could delay release.
**Mitigation**:
- Define MVP as core task management (CLI, JSON store, `.md` files) + basic OpenAI integration (PRD parsing or task expansion).
- Ensure each phase delivers usable functionality.
- Get early user feedback to prioritize features.

### Scope Creep
**Risk**: The project could expand beyond its original task management focus.
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain a strict definition of the tool's purpose (AI-directed task backlog).
- Evaluate new features against the core value proposition.
- Prioritize features directly enhancing the task generation/management workflow for AI execution.

### User Expectations
**Risk**: Users might expect a full IDE integration or complex project management features.
**Mitigation**:
- Clearly communicate Backlog’s focus as a CLI-based task manager for AI direction.
- Document intended workflows and limitations.
- Focus on the unique value of AI-driven task breakdown and management.

## Resource Constraints

### Development Capacity
**Risk**: Limited development resources could delay implementation.
**Mitigation**:
- Phase implementation incrementally (as per roadmap).
- Focus on core functionality first.
- Leverage well-maintained Python open-source libraries.

### AI Cost Management
**Risk**: Excessive OpenAI API usage could lead to high costs.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement token usage tracking and estimates before making calls.
- Add user confirmation for potentially expensive operations (e.g., batch expansion).
- Cache responses where feasible.
- Optimize prompts for clarity and token efficiency.
- Allow users to configure models (e.g., choosing cheaper models like GPT-3.5-turbo).

### Documentation Overhead
**Risk**: Maintaining documentation for an evolving tool can be time-consuming.
**Mitigation**:
- Automate parts of documentation where possible (e.g., CLI help generation).
- Use clear, concise language in code comments and READMEs.
- Build help directly into the CLI (`--help` flags).

# Appendix

## AI Prompt Engineering Specifications (Example Structures)

### PRD Parsing Prompt Structure (for OpenAI)
```
You are an expert project manager assisting in breaking down a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into actionable development tasks for a Python project.

Given the following PRD, generate a list of development tasks.

For each task:
1.  Create a short, descriptive `title`.
2.  Write a concise `description`.
3.  Identify `dependencies` (list the titles or logical predecessors).
4.  Assign a `priority` (high, medium, low).
5.  Suggest initial `details` for implementation approach.
6.  Propose a simple `testStrategy`.

Structure the output as a JSON list of task objects matching the specified fields. Ensure dependencies are logical based on the likely order of implementation.

PRD Content:
```
{prd_content}
```

JSON Output:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "dependencies": [],
    "priority": "high",
    "details": "...",
    "testStrategy": "..."
  },
  {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "dependencies": ["Task Title 1"],
    "priority": "medium",
    "details": "...",
    "testStrategy": "..."
  }
  // ... more tasks
]
```
*(Adjust JSON request based on OpenAI API best practices)*

### Task Expansion Prompt Structure (for OpenAI)
```
You are a senior software engineer helping to break down a development task into smaller, manageable subtasks.

Main Task:
Title: {task_title}
Description: {task_description}
Details: {task_details}

Generate approximately {num_subtasks} specific subtasks required to complete the main task.

For each subtask, provide:
1.  A clear, actionable `title`.
2.  A concise `description` of the work involved.
3.  Any `dependencies` on other *subtasks* generated in this list.
4.  Specific `acceptanceCriteria` to verify its completion.

Output the subtasks as a JSON list of objects, each containing `title`, `description`, `dependencies`, and `acceptanceCriteria`.

Additional context: {additional_context}

JSON Output:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "dependencies": [],
    "acceptanceCriteria": "..."
  },
  {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "dependencies": ["Subtask Title 1"],
    "acceptanceCriteria": "..."
  }
  // ... more subtasks
]
```

### Changes Made
1. **Name Change**:
   - Replaced all instances of "TaskOps" with "Backlog" throughout the document, including the title, section headers, and directory structure comments.

2. **Backlog Concept Section**:
   - Renamed "TaskOps Concept" to "Backlog Concept" and rephrased it to fit "Backlog" as a dynamic task repository for AI, retaining the AI-directed focus but emphasizing a backlog’s role in prioritization and management.

3. **Remove Task Feature**:
   - Already included from the previous update:
     - "Task Data Structure" in Phase 1 includes "delete" in basic operations.
     - "Basic Task Operations" in Phase 1 lists "Add task removal capability."
     - Logical Dependency Chain reflects CRUD (create, read, update, delete).
     - CLI specification includes `remove <id> [--force]`.

4. **Minor Adjustments**:
   - Updated "Scope Creep" mitigation to reference "AI-directed task backlog" for consistency.
   - Adjusted "User Expectations" to align with Backlog’s focus as a CLI-based task manager for AI direction.

The PRD now fully embraces "Backlog" as both a name and a concept, with the remove task feature integrated and the AI-directed task management vision intact. Let me know if you’d like further tweaks or refinements!
